“Driving intelligence into every intersection from congestion to coordination where traffic flows smarter, safer, and greener.”

The uniqueness of our project lies in its real-time adaptive traffic control using low-cost 
components. Unlike conventional traffic signals with fixed timings, our system dynamically 
adjusts signal durations based on the actual traffic queue lengths, improving road efficiency 
and reducing wait times, especially in congested urban intersections. This solution is also 
scalable and easily integrable with smart city frameworks.

Our dynamic signal control optimizes traffic flow by adjusting green light times based on real-time queue lengths, significantly 
reducing wait times and congestion. The automated lighting feature uses LDR sensors to adjust streetlight intensity based on 
ambient light, minimizing energy consumption while maintaining optimal visibility. Our real-time traffic violation detection system, 
powered by the OV7670 camera module, immediately identifies wrong-way vehicles, enhancing road safety and enabling swift 
response from authorities.

The OV7670 module code was integrated by referring to the Circuit Journal article by Indrek Luuk
